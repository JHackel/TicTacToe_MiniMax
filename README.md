# TicTacToe_MiniMax
Project from Fall 2014

As the name suggests, this is a project from when I was in college where I used the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax algorithm</a> to make decisions in a game of tic tac toe.

It should be impossible to beat the tic tac toe player using the minimax algorithm.

Most relevant code is in: TicTacToe_MiniMax/Form1.cs
